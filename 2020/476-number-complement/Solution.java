/*
    Problem Description:

        Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its
        binary representation.
        The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
        You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

        Examples:

            Input: 5
            Output: 2

            Input: 1
            Output: 0
        
    Time  complexity: O(1)
    Space complexity: O(1)
